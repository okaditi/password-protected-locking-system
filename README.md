# SafeKey 🔐 - Intelligent Password-Protected Digital Lock System

SafeKey is a secure, password-based access control system that merges **hardware and software** for enhanced security and intelligent access management. Designed using **Arduino**, this system is ideal for **homes**, **offices**, and **restricted areas** where smart authentication is crucial.

## 🚪 About the Project

The **DSD Digital Lock System** leverages a robust combination of components to deliver a responsive and tamper-resistant locking mechanism. At its core, it uses an **Arduino-controlled keypad** for user input, a **servo motor** for locking and unlocking, and an **LCD display** for real-time user feedback.
